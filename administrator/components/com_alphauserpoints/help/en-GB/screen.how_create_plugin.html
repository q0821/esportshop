<h1>AlphaUserPoints - 1.9.x - How create a plugin - (Basic) </h1>

<p> The creation of a plugin (creation of a new rule for a third component) is divided into 2 phases. 
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="Style1">Step 1 - Inserting  API in your component </span><br />
This course is aimed primarily at developers or any person with a level of knowledge sufficiently advanced in PHP. <br />
<br />
Simply insert the following API in the code component to where you want. The ideal is to follow an action that can bring items to the connected user. For example, in a component of any comments or forum, simply add the API after insertion source code of the commentary or new topic in the database.<br />
<br />
<strong>API:</strong> </p>
<p class="Style5">$api_AUP = JPATH_SITE.DS.'components'.DS.'com_alphauserpoints'.DS.'helper.php';<br />
  if ( file_exists($api_AUP))<br />
  {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;require_once ($api_AUP);<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AlphaUserPointsHelper::newpoints( 'function_name' );<br />
  }</p>
<p><br />
  <b>function_name</b> is the rule which will be used to award points to the current user (if registered and logged). <br />
For all the rules included in AlphaUserPoints (systems), the function names are written as follows: <br />
<br />
example: <i>sysplgaup_newregistered</i> for awarding points to a new registered user. <br />
<br />
It should keep a nomage standard for plugin-third of components as follows: <br />
<br />
<i>plgaup_componentname_function_name<br />
</i><br />
Example <i>plgaup_new_comment</i> or <i>plgaup_kunena_topic_reply</i> to resume the example of the inclusion of this component API in a comment or Kunena forum. <br />
The name of a function to award points when creating a new topic posted in the component Kunena could be, for example, <i>plgaup_kunena_topic_create</i>. <br />
<br />
<span class="Style1">Step 2 - Add a new rule in the rules manager </span><br /> 
Go to the rules manager and click on <b>New</b>  button (Toolbar). Fill all fields necessary and publish this new rule. Then save it. </p>
<p> You can also click on the toolbar button in rules manager or Plugins button control panel component, and then select the file. Zip or. Xml containing the new rule. Upload the file. If the file is uploaded correctly, a new rule will add to the existing list. Set this new rule and enable there to suit your needs.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <span class="Style1">Note to developers </span><br />
  <br />
You can find the complete documentation to insert and use this API in your components on official website author <a href="http://www.alphaplug.com">www.alphaplug.com</a>.</p>
